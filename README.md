## Full-Stack-Javascript-Application
An application where teachers can register and create courses to display to their students. 

## Motivation
This was the final project of the Team Treehouse Fullstack Javascript tech-tegree. 

One of my favorite things about this project was the problem solving that was involved with it. I found myself constantly "googling" and I know that I've learned quite a bit because of that. 

## How to use
Download the files and browse to your local location 
1. Open a Command Prompt or Terminal and enter into "api" folder. 
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies  
3. Run `npm run seed` to create the database and populate it with data 
4. Run `npm start` to run the Node.js Express application 
5. Navigate to the main directory, and then into the "client" folder 
6. Run `npm install` followed by `npm start` once the installation has finished. 

You can view and interact with the application at localhost:3000. Please feel free to use the default user "Joe"
